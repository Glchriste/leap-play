Experiments with the Leap Motion.

Use *recorder.html* to record a gesture as a JSON structure. You have to copy+paste the output into a text file, though I plan to make an app of it soon.

You can view recorded gestures by adjusting the URLs in one of these pages:

* *recorder-diagnostic.html* - a few animations, with many static time-series graphs
* *recorder-visualizer.html* - a simple planar animation
* *recorder-gallery.html* - a gallery of planar animations
